            In the HDD OSD, "SCPH-10000" is returned when the ROM v1.00 is detected (It checks rom0:ROMVER).
            It attempts to read the model name from the ROM OSDSYS program, when ROM v1.01 (late SCPH-10000 and all SCPH-15000 models) is detected.

            The model name was originally hardcoded into the OSDSYS. The MECHACON EEPROM did not have the model name recorded in it.

            Oddly, the console models that come with v1.01, like the SCPH-15000 and DTL-H10000,
            will always be identified as "SCPH-10000" by their ROM OSDSYS programs.
